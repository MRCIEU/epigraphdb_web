## Introduction

Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) show value in prioritizing drug targets in Europeans, but limited data has made identification of causal proteins in other ancestries challenging. Here we present results from a trans-ancestry PWAS analysis pipeline based on cross-population data from Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI). 
We estimated the causal effects of 1,545 proteins on eight complex diseases in up to 32,658 individuals of African ancestry and 1.22 million individuals of European ancestry. 
We identified 45 and 1 protein-disease associations with MR and genetic colocalization evidence in the two ancestries respectively. 
Five MR associations showed differential effects between males and females. 
A trans-ancestry MR comparison identified two protein-disease pairs that showed association evidence in both ancestries, seven MR signals with European specific effects and additional seven with African-specific effects. 
Our results highlight the value of PWAS in informing the generalisability of drugs and drug targets across ancestries and illustrate the value of global biobank meta-analysis of genetic data for drug development.
