## Introduction

Immunotherapy offers a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, where T cells play a central role. However, only a limited number of immuno-chemoprevention targets have been prioritised using population genetic tools. We systematically estimated the putative causal effects of 11,110 dynamic gene expression profiles during CD4+ T cell activation on risk of six cancers using Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization. We identified 887 gene-cancer pairs with robust MR and colocalization evidence to support putative causality (https://omicsharbour.org/sc-eqtl-mr/). Of these pairs, 20% were only detectable using dynamic single-cell eQTLs. Five T cell sub-types, such as TEMRA and nTreg, showed enriched MR signals with cancers. Only 37% of the cancer-associated genes were identifiable in resting T cells, with the remaining genes, such as FADS1, were associated with cancers only after T cell activation. The gene-set enrichment analysis prioritised 32 cancer-associated genes as core genes using protein-protein interaction networks, in which these genes were enriched in pathways involving ribosomal RNA processing and telomere maintenance. Further integrating MR and clinical trial evidence, 11 of 32 (34.4%) of the core genes were drug targets under clinical trial investigation for cancer or immune-related diseases, with CD6, LIPA and MAP2K1 being targets for marketed anti-cancer drugs and the remaining 21 genes as promising immuno-chemoprevention targets. Our study emphasizes the value of dynamic T cell eQTL MR in identifying novel causal genes for cancers and prioritising immuno-chemoprevention targets for cancer prevention.
