## Introduction

Immune cells, especially T cells, have showed key roles on development and progression of complex diseases and offer promising opportunities in immune-mediated drug development. However, only a limited number of immune-mediated drug targets have been prioritised using population genetic tools. Here, we systematically estimated the putative causal effects of 11,110 dynamic gene expression profiles during CD4+ T cell activation on risk of six cancers and two cardiometabolic diseases using Mendelian randomization (MR) and colocalization. All available MR results are searchable via this browser. 
This browser currently contains the Mendelian randomization results for 11,110 gene expression profiles during CD4+ T cells activation on eight complex disease outcomes, i.e. breast cancer or type 2 diabetes. To start using this browser, simply type a gene or disease name into the "search" field, for example, MAP2K1 or breast cancer.
