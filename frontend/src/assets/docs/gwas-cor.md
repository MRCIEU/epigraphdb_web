## Summary

This view provides a "quick-and-dirty" evaluation of shared genetic effects between two traits by estimating the correlation between p-values of all trait associated SNPs. 

*Note that pairwise genetic correlations using LD score regression are planned, and computation of these is in progress.* 

## Data sources

* [EpiGraphDB](www.epigraphdb.org) original data created using data from the IEU GWAS database

## How to use

Enter the trait you are interested in, the correlation coefficient threshold you want to use, then press "Search". You can adjust the slider and press **Search** again to update the results. 

View the top results in the **Network plot** tab, access and search the full results in the **Table** tab, or use the **Query** tab to find out how to download data using the API.
