## Summary

This browser currently contains the Mendelian Randomization results for 1,740 plasma proteins and 16,058 blood transcripts on 576 phenotypes in Europeans.

Single SNP MR contains MR Wald ratio results using only one QTL as instrument. Multi SNP MR contains the MR IVW and Egger results using two or more QTLs as instruments.

## Data sources

[EpiGraphDB](www.epigraphdb.org) original data created using data from the IEU GWAS database, incorporating GWAS from a range of studies and UK Biobank combined with the following molecular trait GWAS results:
