## Summary

Proteome-wide association studies (PWAS) show value in prioritizing drug targets in Europeans, but limited data has made identification of causal proteins in other ancestries challenging. Here we present a trans- ancestry PWAS analysis pipeline based on cross-population data from Global Biobank Meta-analysis Initiative (GBMI). We estimated the causal effects of 1,545 proteins on eight complex diseases in up to 32,653 individuals of African ancestry and 1.22 million individuals of European ancestry. We identified 386 and 87 pairs of potential protein-disease causal effects with PWAS and genetic colocalization evidence in the two ancestries respectively. Five PWAS signals showed differential effects between males and females. A trans-ancestry PWAS comparison identified 29 protein-disease pairs that showed evidence of causal effects in both ancestries, of which 11 replicated using independent pQTL data. Integrating these PWAS signals with observational and clinical trial evidence, we were able to evaluate the efficacy of three existing drugs, identify five drug repurposing opportunities and predict three novel effects of proteins on disease. Our results highlight the value of PWAS in informing the generalisability of drugs and drug targets across ancestries and illustrate the value of global biobank meta-analysis of genetic data for drug development.
