## Summary

This view provides mapping from a GWAS trait to a disease term via an ontology term based on EFO (Experimental Factor Ontoloty). Mapping from GWAS trait to EFO term is done via semantic similartities calculated by [Vectology](http://vectology.mrcieu.ac.uk). Mapping from EFO to disease term is done by mappings provided from [MONDO](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/).
