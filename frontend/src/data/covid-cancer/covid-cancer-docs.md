# The network of SARS-CoV-2—cancer molecular interactions and pathways 

Summary

The long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection may have a potential impact on pathways relevant to cancer. Here we present the network of molecular interactions between human genes targeted by SARS-CoV-2, known cancer genes derived from the literature, and genetic risk factors for critical illness in COVID-19, for six different tissues expressing ACE2 receptor.
